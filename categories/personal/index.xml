      <description>I have been programming and developing applications for over 9 years now, with 4 years of professional experience. I have a constant will to learn new skills and technologies in the field of application development, computer networks and security. In my free time I love to build and fly FPV racing drones, listen to music and philosophize.
Skills Lately I got a chance to work as a full stack engineer which included Kotlin and NodeJS backend development with Spring Boot and ExpressJS, for the web and mobile clients I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with React and React Native technologies.</description>
